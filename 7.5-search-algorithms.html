    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <p>
      To develop and write linear and binary search algorithms with guidance<br>
      To be able to describe the efficiency of an algorithm using "Big O" notation

    <h3>Search Algorithms</h3>
    <p>
      Algorithm Steps
      1. Get array and target values
      2. Set a counter to i = 0
      3. Check if the element at arr[i] is equa; tp the target values
      4. If element matches, return index (i). Otherwise, increment i by ny 1 and repeat step 3
      5. If the index is greater than the last index of the arrau, return -1 to indicate the target value was not found.

    </p>

    <h3>Linear Search Algorithm</h3>
    Linear (or sequential) search checks each element in an array for a target value from start (i = 0) to end (i = length – 1) until the target is found or the end of the array is reached.​

Algorithm Steps​

Get array and target value​

Set a counter to i = 0​

Check if the element at arr[i] is equal to the target value​

If element matches, return index (i). Otherwise, increment i by 1 and repeat step 3​

If the index is greater than the last index of the array, return -1 to indicate the target value was not found 
    <p>

    </p>

    <h3>Binary Search Algorithm</h3>
    Binary search requires the data to be sorted from least to greatest​

Algorithm Steps​

Sort the array in ascending order​

Set the low index to 0 and high index to length – 1​

Set the middle index to the average of the low and high indices​

If the middle index is the target, return the middle index​

If the target element is less than the element at the middle index, set the high index to the middle index – 1​

If the target element is greater than the element at the middle index, set the low index to the middle index + 1​

Repeat steps 3-6 until it is found, or the low and high index are equal in which case, the target is not in the array
    <p>

    </p>

    <h3>Algorithm Efficiency</h3>
    Algorithm efficiency is often represented by how many maximum steps it would take for the algorithm to run​

Computer scientists use what is called “Big O” notation to represent this​

The efficiency of the linear search algorithm is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array to be searched​

O(n) means that that maximum number of steps it will take to find an element in an array is equal to the number of elements in the array​

Binary search has efficiency O(log2 n)​

An array with 100 elements would take a maximum of log2 100 which is equal to 6.64 so between 6 and 7 steps
